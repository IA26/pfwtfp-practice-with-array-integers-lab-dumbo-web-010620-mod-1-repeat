# Practice with Array Integers

## Introduction

In this lab, we'll solidify our understanding of how array integers work and how
to perform various operations on them.

## Learning Goals

- Perform operations on arrays

## Perform Operations on Arrays

Your task is to write a series of methods that extract specific values from an
input array of integers. These methods should work with any array of integers,
but one is provided as an example to work with on the first line of
`lib/array_practice.rb`:

```ruby
array_of_integers = *0..50
# => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,  ...  47, 48, 49]
```

> This method of array creation uses a 'splat' operator on a [range]. This is a
> shorthand method for creating and assigning an array of integers

Below this are the methods you must write implementation for. Read the provided
comments to see what each method should do. Run `learn` to test your solution.

## Conclusion

There are many ways to manipulate arrays of integers. These operations are
common enough that some of the methods you've written are actually built into
Ruby as class methods. Being able to access and modify array data
