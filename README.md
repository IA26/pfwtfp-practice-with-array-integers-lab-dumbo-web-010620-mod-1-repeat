# Practice with Array Integers

## Introduction

In this lab, we'll solidify our understanding of how array integers work and how
to perform various operations on them.

## Learning Goals

- Perform operations on arrays

## Perform Operations on Arrays

We're going to write code to get all of the following results from the integers
in our array:

- all of the odd numbers all of the even numbers the square of all the numbers
- the first number whose square is > 350 all the numbers whose square is > 350
- all the numbers, cubed the first number whose cube is > 500 all the numbers
- whose cube is < 500
